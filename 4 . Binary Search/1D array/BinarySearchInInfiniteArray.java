// in this question basically we have  assume that the length of the array is infinite and we can't use the array.length function to find the length of the array . so what we will do is that we have to move in chunk like in the opposite direction as in case of binary search , we move from up to down but in the case of this question we will follow a different approach that we will move from down to upside multiplying the range of array by 2.
